alpha ver.1.2 Update News 1 : The decaygate function now contains the elimination of the background.

alpha ver.1.2 Update News 2 : The decaygate function now asks the degree of the data compression(the bin size).

alpha ver.1.3 Update News 1 : The netarea function now uses the gaussian fitting to get the exact net area including the error.

alpha ver.1.4 Update News 1 : The netarea function now does not remove the background by using TSpectrum. Instead, now the function fits the background with the linear function to remove the background.

alpha ver.1.5 Update News 1 : This program now performs the efficiency calibration by using the external data file.

alpha ver.2.0 Update News 1 : Now this program works with its own CLASS header file.

alpha ver.2.1 Update News 1 : The timegrow function now works with the fit process not using TSpectrum anymore.
